## Install & run frontend.

Frontend is programmed with React and I used ViteJS.

In root folder use the command : 

npm install

To launch front end :

npm run dev

To have more informations about ViteJS :

Few style files are using SASS but I had few errors between Recharts and SASS so for graph's styles I used classical CSS.
But for this project, only CSS files should be better, SASS wasn't usefull.

ESlint is present to check code quality with recommanded settings.

If you have any problems to install or launch this, you can make an issue on Github.

Thanks :)
